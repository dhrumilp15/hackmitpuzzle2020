# hackmitpuzzle2020
My solutions for HackMIT's 2020 Entrance Puzzle! My team solved all the puzzles, but puzzle 1 and puzzles after puzzle 5 have their own platform. If the puzzle platform is up, you should 10000% try out the puzzles (they're lots of fun)!

For puzzle 2, I wrote the solution with Google Colab. Check it out here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DdqxWDj-yxiJWPbV9GHCTIlRcc9LiRHQ?usp=sharing.
